# SQL

See [the Lambda page on Relational
Databases](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Relational-Databases) for more
information. (Note that page is for PostgreSQL, but the SQL information is valid
here.)

## SQLite

SQLite is a popular, simple SQL database.

You can launch into a memory-only DB by running:

```
sqlite3
```

You can specify a persistent DB file with:

```
sqlite3 mydatabase.db
```

When you get to the prompt, you can type `.help` for commands.

Some helpful ones:

- `.mode column` turn on column output for `SELECT`.
- `.header on` turn on column headers for `SELECT`.
- `.read filename` execute the SQL in `filename`.
- `.open dbname` re-open a memory-only DB to a persistent file.
- `.quit` exit SQLite. (Note that if you're using a memory-only DB, all
  data is lost at this point.)

Another potentially useful third-party tool is [DB Browser for
SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/), a GUI-based SQLite viewer and data
manipulator that can also run SQL queries.

## Create a Music Database

Make an albums table to hold album information:

```sql
CREATE TABLE album (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    release_year INTEGER
);
```

Make an artists table to hold artist information:

```sql
CREATE TABLE artist (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL
);
```

### Exercises, Day 1

Before you begin, look at the queries in `setup.sql` to get a hint as to the
column names in the following tables. We'll use `setup.sql` later.

- Create a table called `track` that holds information about a music track. It should contain:

  - An autoincrementing `id`
  - A title (of type `VARCHAR`, probably)
  - A reference to an `id` in table `album` (the album the track is on). This
    should be a _foreign key_.

- Create a table called `artist_album` to connect artists to albums. (Note that
  an artist might have several albums and an album might be created by multiple
  artists.)

  - Use foreign keys for this, as well.

- Run the queries in the file `setup.sql`. This will populate the tables.

  - Fix any errors at this point by making sure your tables are correct.
  - `DROP TABLE` can be used to delete a table so you can recreate it with
    `CREATE TABLE`.

- Write SQL `SELECT` queries that:

  - Show all albums.
  - Show all albums made between 1975 and 1990.
  - Show all albums whose names start with `Super D`.
  - Show all albums that have no release year.

- Write SQL `SELECT` queries that:

  - Show all track titles from `Super Funky Album`.

  SELECT track.title FROM track, album WHERE track.album_id = album.id AND album.title = "Super Funky Album";
  title

  - Same query as above, but rename the column from `title` to `Track_Title` in
    the output.

  - Select all album titles by `Han Solo`.
    select album.title, artist.name from album, artist
    where artist.name like 'Han Solo';

  - Select the average year all albums were released.
    select AVG(release_year) from album where release_year IS NOT NULL;

  - Select the average year all albums by `Leia and the Ewoks`


    select AVG(release_year) from album, artist_album, artist
    where artist_album.artist_id = artist.id and
    artist_album.album_id = album.id and
    artist.name = "Leia and the Ewoks";

* Select the number of artists.
  select count(id) from artist;
* Select the number of tracks on `x.

### Exercises, Day 2

Create a database for taking notes.

- What are the columns that a note table needs?

- If you have a timestamp field, how do you auto-populate it with the date?

- A note should have a foreign key pointing to an author in an author table.

- What columns are needed for the author table?

Write queries that:

- Insert authors to the author table.

- Insert notes to the note table.

- Select all notes by an author's name.

- Select author for a particular note by note ID.

- Select the names of all the authors along with the number of notes they each have. (Hint: `GROUP BY`.)

- Delete authors from the author table.

  > Note that SQLite doesn't enforce foreign key constrains by default. You have
  > to enable them by running `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;` before your queries.

  - What happens when you try to delete an author with an existing note?
  - How can you prevent this?

Submit a file `notes.sql` with the queries that build (`CREATE TABLE`/`INSERT`)
and query the database as noted above.
